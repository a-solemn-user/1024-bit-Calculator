Q:   How will this work? 

A:   Basicly this reads the number you are imputing and after you imput a number bigger than the 64bit intiger limit it will split the number in to 16ths do the rest of the work (add, subtract, multiply, devide, whatever idc) to the second number (follow the same procidure of looking to see the size and if it goes over the limit it will split into 16th) add the two numbers together and remultiply by 16 at the end. 

Q:  What is planed for the furter?

A:  Powers, graphing, limits, matrics, tirg stuff, roots, intigration, darviation, 3d Graphing. This should replace you online calculator in all ways. You will know this is fully releced bc I will change the name to Calculator++.
